This  project  is basic representation ,how load is transefered and balanced b/w the servers.
Firstly a Client makes a request for the server.
Then this reqest is transfered to the loadbalancer.py which checks for servers availability .
LoadBalancer.py has a list of servers from which it checks for the online server or the servers which can accomodate reuests.
After finding the available server it transefers the request  to the available server and then the server responds to the client that the connection is established.
This loadbalancer checks for the avaialable server after a short timeout so as to reduce load on a single server
